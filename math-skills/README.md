# Math Skills

## Overview

The **Math Skills** project involves calculating key statistical measures: **Average**, **Median**, **Variance**, and **Standard Deviation**. The program will read numerical data from a file and output these statistics as rounded integers.

## How to Use

1. **Input**: The program reads a file containing one value per line, representing a statistical population.
   
2. **Run**: 
   $ go run your-program.go data.txt

3. **Output**: 
   Average: 35
   Median: 4
   Variance: 5
   Standard Deviation: 65

## Project Requirements

- Read data from a file.
- Perform the following calculations:
  - **Average**
  - **Median**
  - **Variance**
  - **Standard Deviation**
- Output each result, rounded to the nearest integer.

## Example Input

189
113
121
114
145
110
...

## Example Output

Average: 138
Median: 121
Variance: 680
Standard Deviation: 26

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding and applying statistical concepts.
- Implementing file reading and data processing in your chosen language.
